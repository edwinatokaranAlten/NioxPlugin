# ✅ DLL Loading Fix Applied

## Problem Identified

Your diagnostic report showed:
```
DLL Path: C:\Users\...\AppX\NioxCommunicationPlugin.dll
DLL Exists: False
ERROR: DLL file not found!
```

The DLL wasn't being copied to the MSIX package's `AppX` folder during build.

## Root Cause

In `NioxBluetoothApp.csproj`, there was a conflicting configuration:

```xml
<!-- ❌ THIS WAS REMOVING THE DLL -->
<None Remove="Libraries\NioxCommunicationPlugin.dll" />

<!-- Then trying to include it (conflict!) -->
<Content Include="Libraries\NioxCommunicationPlugin.dll">
  <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
</Content>
```

## Fix Applied

I've updated the `.csproj` file to properly include the DLL:

```xml
<!-- ✅ FIXED: Proper DLL inclusion for MSIX apps -->
<ItemGroup>
  <Content Include="Libraries\NioxCommunicationPlugin.dll">
    <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    <CopyToPublishDirectory>Always</CopyToPublishDirectory>
    <!-- Critical: Link ensures it goes into AppX folder -->
    <Link>NioxCommunicationPlugin.dll</Link>
  </Content>
</ItemGroup>
```

**Key changes:**
1. ✅ Removed the `<None Remove>` line that was excluding the DLL
2. ✅ Added `<CopyToPublishDirectory>Always</CopyToPublishDirectory>`
3. ✅ Added `<Link>NioxCommunicationPlugin.dll</Link>` to put it in the root of AppX

## Next Steps - **DO THIS NOW IN VISUAL STUDIO:**

### 1. Clean and Rebuild

In Visual Studio:
```
1. Build → Clean Solution
2. Build → Rebuild Solution
```

Or from command line:
```bash
dotnet clean
dotnet build -c Debug
```

### 2. Verify DLL is Copied

After rebuilding, check this folder:
```
bin\x64\Debug\net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0\win-x64\AppX\
```

You should now see `NioxCommunicationPlugin.dll` in that folder.

### 3. Run Diagnostics Again

1. Run the app (F5)
2. Click **"Run DLL Diagnostics"**
3. You should now see:
   ```
   DLL Exists: True ✅
   LoadLibrary SUCCESS! ✅
   ```

### 4. Test Bluetooth Functionality

If diagnostics pass:
1. Click **"Refresh Status"** to check Bluetooth state
2. Click **"Scan for Devices"** to scan for NIOX devices

## If You Still Get Errors

### Error: "DLL Exists: True" but "LoadLibrary FAILED"

This means the DLL is there but can't be loaded. Common causes:

**Error Code 0x7E (126) - Module Not Found:**
- Missing dependencies (MinGW runtime DLLs)
- Solution: Use [Dependencies.exe](https://github.com/lucasg/Dependencies) to check for missing DLLs

**Error Code 0xC1 (193) - Bad EXE Format:**
- Architecture mismatch
- Solution: Ensure you're building for **x64** (not x86)

### Check Your Build Configuration

In Visual Studio:
1. Go to: **Build → Configuration Manager**
2. Verify:
   - "Active solution platform" = **x64**
   - Project platform = **x64**
3. If it says "x86" or "ARM64", change it to **x64**

## What Was Wrong?

The `<None Remove>` directive was preventing the DLL from being included in the build output. This is a common issue when:

1. You add a file to the project
2. Visual Studio auto-generates `<None Remove>`
3. Then you manually add it as `<Content Include>`
4. The "Remove" wins and the file is excluded

The `<Link>` tag is critical for MSIX/AppX packaged apps because it tells MSBuild to put the file in the root of the package, not in a subdirectory.

## Verification Checklist

After rebuild, verify:

- [ ] `Libraries\NioxCommunicationPlugin.dll` exists in your project folder
- [ ] DLL appears in `bin\x64\Debug\...\win-x64\` folder
- [ ] DLL appears in `bin\x64\Debug\...\win-x64\AppX\` folder
- [ ] Diagnostics shows "DLL Exists: True"
- [ ] Diagnostics shows "LoadLibrary SUCCESS"
- [ ] All 6 functions are found (niox_init, niox_check_bluetooth, etc.)
- [ ] Version test shows "1.0.0"

## Additional Notes

### For MSIX Packaged Apps (Your Case)

When `EnableMsixTooling` is true (line 12 in .csproj), the app runs from the `AppX` folder. Files must be explicitly included with `<Link>` to be accessible.

### For Unpackaged Apps

If you disable MSIX packaging in the future, the DLL would be loaded from:
```
bin\x64\Debug\net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0\win-x64\
```

## Success Criteria

When everything works, the diagnostics report should look like:

```
=== DLL Diagnostics Report ===

Application Directory: C:\Users\...\AppX\
DLL Path: C:\Users\...\AppX\NioxCommunicationPlugin.dll
DLL Exists: True
DLL Size: 2,142,720 bytes

Attempting to load DLL...
✅ LoadLibrary SUCCESS!
Handle: 0x7FF...

Checking exported functions:
  ✅ niox_init - Found (0x7FF...)
  ✅ niox_check_bluetooth - Found (0x7FF...)
  ✅ niox_scan_devices - Found (0x7FF...)
  ✅ niox_free_string - Found (0x7FF...)
  ✅ niox_cleanup - Found (0x7FF...)
  ✅ niox_version - Found (0x7FF...)

Testing niox_version() call:
  ✅ Version: 1.0.0

✅ DLL unloaded successfully

=== Diagnostics Complete ===
The DLL appears to be working correctly!
